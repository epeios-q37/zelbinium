# *Zelbinium*

**To free our youth from the grip of the tech giants!**

*Python* is a versatile and highly accessible language, whose outstanding success has led to the emergence of technologies that enable it to be used in applications running directly in a web browser.

*Brython*, one of these technologies, offers our teenagers the opportunity to create their own applications, for and with their smartphones, diverting them from social media and video games and their attendant addictions.

What's more, *Zelbinium* extends *Brython*'s capabilities to enable them to easily share their creations, leading them to forge bonds with their buddies that reduce the risk of harassment.

By combining in an unprecedented way the two highly popular and well-documented languages that are *Python* and *HTML*, *Zelbinium* facilitates the creation of truly connected applications that our children will be proud to share with their friends and family.

All too often a source of tension, the smartphone is transformed by *Zelbinium* into a wonderful opportunity for parents to share precious moments of complicity with their children.

No application to install, no account to create; whether from a smartphone, tablet or personal computer, *Zelbinium* is directly accessible at <https://zelbinium.q37.info>!
