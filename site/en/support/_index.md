Are you afraid your children are spending too much time on their smartphone? Do you fear addiction or that this will have other dramatic repercussions for them?

![](./Cyberharcelement.jpeg)

By providing access to the only application in the world that enables quick and easy creation of true [connected applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) <u>with</u> and <u>for</u> their smartphone, *Zelbinium* offers young people a particularly attractive alternative to video games and social media, while being considerably less addictive.

These applications being easily shareable via an ordinary [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) or a simple link sent by [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) or [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging), *Zelbinium* will give them the opportunity to multiply interactions with their pals, allowing them to get to know and appreciate each other better, and thus reducing the risk of harassment.

The langages used with *Zelbinium* are extremely widespread and well documented. Easy to use, they are also very well suited to handle images, sounds, videos, music, animations... Your children will be able to give free rein to their imagination in a wide range of fields.

Several children can thus collaborate on the same application. Depending on their preferences, some will be in charge of programming, others of sound, still others of graphics... allowing them to discover teamwork while having fun, thus strengthening their bonds with their peers.

![](./Collaboration.jpeg)

Zelbinium is operational on smartphones (*Android* and *iOS*), but also on tablets and personal computers (*Windows*, *Mac*, *Linux*...), and, in general, on any device equipped with a modern web browser connected to the Internet (yes, even your connected TV!).

Enjoy precious moments of complicity with your children by accompanying them as they discover *Zelbinium*. You can also [help](../contribute) by spreading the word about *Zelbinium*, especially among the organizations that welcome your children.
