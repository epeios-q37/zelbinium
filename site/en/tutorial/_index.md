# Writing an application from A to Z

This tutorial shows you how to develop an application from scratch. It is divided into two parts.

The first part ([*Interface*](./frontend)) is dedicated to the development of the application's interface. It uses *HTML*, a widely used and well-documented language.

The second part ([*Processing*](./backend)) is dedicated to the coding of the processing part of the application. We'll be using the *Atlas* toolkit in its *Python* version, a very popular language with a vast community, slightly modified to be run in a web browser.

The code developed in the first part of the tutorial will be reused in the second part, resulting in a functional application that can be modified at will and used as inspiration for your own applications, all directly in your web browser.
