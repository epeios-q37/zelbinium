By contributing to or [supporting](../support) this project, you will improve the well-being of our children by changing their relationship to smartphones and digital technology in general.

Spread the word about this project to your own children and to children you know, as well as to people who come into contact with children, whether within the family or through other activities.

This entire site and the source code for the applications it contains are available on the https://github.com/epeios-q37/zelbinium repository, through which you can suggest improvements or new content. You can also contact the author of this project via the [contact](../contact) page.

Thanks to *Zelbinium*'s innovative features, your children will be able to easily share their progress with you, making the smartphone no longer a source of tension, but an opportunity to bring you closer together. Encourage your children, or better still, help them with their new activities. The more you get involved, the more *Zelbinium* will benefit your children, and the more it will benefit *Zelbinium*.
